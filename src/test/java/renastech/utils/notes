Who decides smoke testing?
--in Grooming meeting, tester, developer and PO (3 AMIGOS)

How do you do smoke testing in cucumber?
we just add @Smoketesting tags to scenarios and just change tags as @@Smoketesting and run them
they are like regular testing.There is no other way in cucumber to test smoke


smoke ve regression'i ayni test suit'e konur mu test yapmak icin???
--bunun 2 yolu var.. exising feature'in icine koyup da yapabilirsin tag ile, ya da
yeni bir feature create edersin ve mesela smoke_testing.feature gibi smoke scenario'larini bunun icine koyup test edersin
