CLOUD SERVERS:
1-AWS --MOST POPULAR AND MOST DEMANDED bec. so easy, so secure
2-GOOGLE CLOUD
3-MICROSOFT AZURE

why are we using cloud computing???
1-cost efficent--it hels us reaching everywhere.. many people reach out cloud computing from their region

AWS has multiple locations, US, EU,ASIA.. ->16,, UPCOMING 6 REGIONS
In AWS our most used virtual server in cloud is EC2 machine, you can use it for any purpose

WHAT IS EC2 MACHINE?
A CORE PART OF AMAZON"S CLOUD COMPUTIN GPLATFORM
WE ARE CALLING IT INSTANCE

TERMINOLOGIES:
1-INSTANCE= ONE RUNNING VIRTUAL MACHINE
2-INSTANCE TYPE: HARDWARE CONFIGURATION:CORES, MEMORY, DISK
3-INSTANCE STORE VOLUME=TEMPOPARY DISK ASSOCIATED WITH INSTANCE
4-IMAGE(AMI): STORED BITS WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO INSTANCES--COPY OF VIRTUAL MACHINE, IF YOU NEED, IT GIVES YOU A COPY
5-REGION: GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, PRICE, LAWS, NETWORK LOCALITY
AVAILABILITY ZONE: SUBDIVISION OF REGION IS FAULT-INDEPENDENT
6-KEY PAIR: CREDENTIALS USED TO ACCESS VM FROM COMMAND LINE


GETTING STARTED WITH AMAZON EC2:
STEP 1  SIGN UP AMAZON EC2
STEP 2  CREATE KEY PAIR
STEP 3  LAUNCH AN AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE
STEP 4  CONNECT TO THE INSTANCE
STEP 5  CUSTIMISE THE INSTANCE
STEP 6  TERMINATE INSTANCE AND DELETE THW VOLUME CREATED

MESELA NEDEN NETFLIX USES THOUSAND OF SERVERS???
BECAUSE OF INTERNET LATENCY(GECIKME), TO PROVIDE SPEED AND FAST ACCESS THEY HAVE TOUANDS OF SERVERS

DOCKER??
IT IS LIKE A CONTAINER
TUM SAHIP OLMAN GEREKEN BILESENLER DOCKER'DA TOPLANIR VE ALL PAERT OF APP. WORKS IN SEPARETE CONTAINERS
ISTEDIGIN SEYI ORADAN CAGIRIRI VE KULLANIRSIN, IXINDE WINDOWS, LINUX, MAC OLDUGUNU DUSUN VE SEN HANGISINI ISTIYORSAN ONU KULLANIRSIN
YOU WANNA RUN TEST CASES BUT YOUR REQUIRES SAYS I WANNA RUN 5 OF THEM IN SMOKE TESTING BUT I RUN THEM IN WINDOWS,
LINUX AND MAC OS, I WANNA RUN THEM IN CHROME(WINDOWS), FIREFOX, SAFARI(SAFARI), OPERA (LINUX)
ALL OF THEM EXECUTE IN DOCKER, OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE HEAVY, MY  LAPTOP MIGH NOT HANDLE ALL THESE THINGS
AMA GENELDE DOCKER LINUX VE WINDOSLA CALISIR CUNKU SETUP'I KOLAY

PEKI VIRTUAL MACHINE VE DOCKER ARASINDAKI FARK NE??
IN VIRTUAL. EACH VIRTUSL MACHINE HAS THEIR OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE IT
BUT IN DOCKER EACH ONE HAS THEIR OWN OPERATING SYSTEM IN THE CONTAINERS AND ISOLATE FROM OTHERS

CODKER IS FREE SOURCE
AWS IS NOT FREE, BUT SOME SERVICES ARE FREE


DOCKER'LA SENIN ISIN YOK IS HAYATINDA DA SETUPININ KURULMASINDA INVOLVE OLMUYORSUN, AMA NE OLDGUNU BILIYORSUN
HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENED WITH DOCKER??
NO, BUT I KNOW WHAT IS IT

KUBERNETES:
GOOGLE EVERY YEAR NEEDS BILLIONS OF CONTANIERS BECAUSE IT HAS LOTS OF PRODUCT
THASTW WHY GOOGLE DESIGN KUBERNETES--OPEN SOURCE
IT HELPS IN AUTOMATING APP DEPLOYMENT, SCALLING, MANAGEMENT
IT PROVIES CONNECTION BETWEEN ALL CONTANIERS
MANY COMPANYIES DOSNT USE IT BEC. IT IS BRAND NEW

MICROSERVISES
IT IS REALLY OLD


DOCKERS --DIFFERENT CONTAINERS IN DIFFERENT ARES
KUBERNETIES--  ALL COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER
